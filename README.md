Smart Precision Weighing System
A smart weighing system for accurate weight and count measurement of stacked sheets (e.g. cardboard) or other materials, incorporating environmental compensation and laser height detection.

🚀 Features
✅ Precise Weight Measurement

Uses a load cell to measure total weight of material stacks.

✅ Height Measurement

Laser height sensor determines stack height for verification and counting.

✅ Environmental Compensation

Adjusts calculations for variations in temperature and humidity to ensure accurate results.

✅ Single Microcontroller Design

All components integrated into one MCU for reduced cost and complexity.

✅ Altitude Respond Count

System outputs precise weight and an estimated count of sheets or objects in the stack.

⚙️ Working Principle
Weight Measurement
The load cell measures the total weight of the stack.

Height Detection
The laser height sensor measures the physical height of the stack for cross-verification.

Environmental Reading
Temperature and humidity sensors monitor environmental conditions affecting material weight (e.g. cardboard absorbs moisture).

Environmental Compensation
Compensation algorithms adjust the weight readings based on humidity and temperature variations.

Output Calculation
The microcontroller calculates:

Actual weight (after compensation)

Estimated sheet count based on known single-sheet weight and measured height.

Final Output
Displayed or transmitted as the Altitude Respond Count.
